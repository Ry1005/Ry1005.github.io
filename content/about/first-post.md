## Experience

### PC Technician at Lone Star College

I am currently a PC Technician at Lone Star College. I troubleshoot and diagnose technology issues and use ServiceNow IT ticketing system to manage service requests, incidents, and projects. I assist in the management of over 2000 devices in the college's inventory by updating asset tags and room numbers for devices in ServiceNow. 

### Cyber Security Intern at KPMG

During the summer of 2023 I worked at KPMG as a Cyber Security Intern in their Houston office. Throughout my internship I worked with an intern team on a project. This project was to propose a digital solution to reduce wait times and increase revenue at a hospital while considering cyber security. We used AdvisoryGPT, KPMG's version of ChatGPT to conduct research and help us come up with ideas while brainstorming. We chose to use Microsoft Azure products for our solution and researched how they could be used to comply with regulations such as HIPPA.

Additionally, throughout my internship, I shadowed managers and gained exposure to software such as CyberArk and ServiceNow. I learned about NIST 800-53, fundamentals of PAM, and project management.

### Cyber Security Trainee at CyberNow Labs

During my last semester in college I got into CyberNow Labs training program. In this program I learned about cyber security concepts that prepared me to take the CompTIA Security+ exam. I learned concepts like risk management, encryption, and social engineering.

### IT Apprentice at Genesys Works

During my time as an IT Apprentice, I learned skills such as cyber security, OS configuration, hardware configuration, IT infrastructure, and data backup. I attended in person labs bi-weekly and learned concepts such as pc building, terminating an ethernet cable, and creating a Windows usb installation media. I also attended professional development training going over public speaking, communication etiquette, and time management once a month.

## Free Time

In my free time, I like to play tennis, pickleball, and video games. I also enjoy spending time with my friends and family.
