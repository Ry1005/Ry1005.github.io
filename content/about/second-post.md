To whom it may concern,

It is with enthusiasm that I provide additional support to Ryan Nguyen’s professional endeavors through a recommendation letter. During my role as Sr. Workforce Coordinator at Genesys Works, I spent over 6 months working with Ryan as he went through our IT Pre-apprenticeship program. I taught professional skills training, as well as met with Ryan regularly to discuss his trajectory within the program. I observed Ryan take on the rigorous training, employ what he learned during hands-on, lab experiences and receive his CompTIA A+ certification.

Genesys Works’ IT Pre-apprenticeship is a state-recognized training, with a selective application process. Ryan’s professionalism and commitment to his development stood out in his application. During his interview, he exuded confidence as he shared how he planned to balance his final semester of college at UH with the program. Ryan graduated college and successfully finished our 10-hour/week training with his cohort while attending school full-time. His experience was marked by great time management skills, stellar communication and problem-solving abilities as he navigated a busy and demanding schedule.

Within the training, Ryan mastered several IT concepts: including computer hardware, hardware and software troubleshooting, and computer literacy. Additionally, Ryan practiced networking, and security protocols within our hands-on labs. Labs allowed Ryan to practice wired and wireless networking concepts, install Linux OS, and evaluate system performance using open-source tools. He expressed continuous interest in IT throughout the 13-week training and receivied his A+ Certification shortly after completing the training.

As a dedicated and knowledgeable graduate of our program, I know that Ryan will be an excellent addition to your organization. Please feel free to contact me at vperez@genesysworks.org should you like to discuss Ryan’s qualifications any further.

Best, \
